[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) experiment based on the [Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms). Visit [voidcluster on GitHub](https://github.com/rdela/voidcluster), or read the [Netlify CMS docs on templates](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/) for elaboration. Don’t tell anyone but you can check out the [new page test](/p/new-page-test/) because you’re special.
